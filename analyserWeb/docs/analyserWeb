# analyser-web

A modern, browser-based 3D graphing tool that visualizes functions of the form `z = f(x, y)` using React, TypeScript, math.js, and Three.js.

This project is a complete refactoring of a legacy DOS-based function analysis tool into a modular, web-native application.

## 🚀 Features

- Live input of mathematical expressions
- Real-time surface rendering with Three.js
- Dynamic sampling grid resolution
- Interactive view controls (zoom, rotate, shift, z-scale)
- Modular core for formula evaluation and transformation
- Fully written in TypeScript
- Tested with Vitest
