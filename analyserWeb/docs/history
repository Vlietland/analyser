The old project, located in the legacyCode directory, was a graphical application for analyzing and visualizing mathematical functions, particularly 3D surfaces defined by equations of the form F(x,y). The application allowed users to input equations, perform various transformations (such as rotation, zooming, and shifting), and adjust parameters like Z-factor.

Key Components:
1. Equation Input and Processing: The FORMULE.CPP module handled user input for equations, converted the input into a machine-readable format, and checked for errors. It used a parser to analyze the equations and identify critical points like X and Y values.

2. Graphical Rendering: The ANALYSER.CPP file was the main program file, responsible for initializing the graphics environment, creating the user interface, and handling user interactions through buttons and keyboard input. It utilized a graphics library (likely BGI - Borland Graphics Interface) for rendering.

3. User Interface: The application had a button-based interface with options for analysis, rotation, zooming, shifting, and configuration. The interface was divided into different viewports for displaying the graphical output, formula input, and other information.

4. Mathematical Calculations: Various modules (like COORSYS.CPP, VARIABEL.CPP) likely performed the actual mathematical calculations for coordinate transformations and other operations.
